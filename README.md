## Exercise: Print Even Numbers

### Objective:

- Write a Java program that prints all even numbers between a specified range of integers. 
- The program should ask the user to enter the starting and ending values of the range, and then display the even numbers within that range.

### Instructions:

1. Ask the user to enter the starting value of the range.
2. Ask the user to enter the ending value of the range.
3. Use a for loop to iterate through the range of numbers.
4. Check if the current number is even (i.e., divisible by 2).
5. If it is even, print the number.
6. Display the even numbers within the specified range.
